## Brief
I’m a digital artist/animator, creative technologist, and wanna-be game dev with 15 years in the media industry. I blend pixels, code, and chaotic good energy to bring ideas to life. Whether I’m animating something ridiculous, building tools in search of better loot, or making a game just because games are freakin’ awesome — I’m always chasing the next creative quest.

## 💻 Skills

- **After Effects:** Advanced motion graphics and plugin development
- **Adobe Fresco:** 2D animation and illustration
- **Character Animator:** Rigging, animating, and creating repeatable formats for cartoons
- **Photoshop:** Digital art and photo editing
- **Illustrator:** Vector graphics and illustration
- **Cinema 4D:** 3D modeling and animation
- **Chat GPT:** I just mess with it a lot, integrating it into a bunch of different junk I do.
